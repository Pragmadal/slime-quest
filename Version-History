The project will reach BETA status as soon as it has all the working functions of a basic rpg game. A battle system, a leveling system, 
items, a skill system, interactability, and lore.

The project will reach RELEASE status as soon as it has fully implemented GUI, music, more content, and mechanics that I find satisfactory.

Future versions would then be added to bring in new mechanics and ideas, working with the base to undergo new ideas.
